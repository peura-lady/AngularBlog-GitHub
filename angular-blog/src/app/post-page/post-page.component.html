            Angular is the most valuable framework in the technology arena because of its simplicity. At the same time,
            it releases updates in line with industry trends.<br />

            The first benefit is two-way data binding. It allows developers to create templates faster. Any changes made
            to a view or view layer are automatically and instantly reflected in the model. Simply put, Angular is built
            on top of the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture, which allows developers to easily make changes. Any
            changes made to the "Model" instantly change the "View".<br />

            Another advantage is DOM manipulation, a programming interface for HTML and XML that helps developers define
            the logical structure of documents and manipulate the document. Developers gain ease of manipulation of the
            DOM (Document Object Model) through a two-way data binding approach. And this is not possible with other
            JavaScript frameworks. DOM manipulation helps developers save time as they just need to translate and update
            DOM elements.<br />

            The increased server performance reduces the load on the server's CPUs, and the reduced traffic helps the
            server perform well by caching and supporting other processes. Simply put, Angular only serves static files
            and responds directly to API calls, which reduces the load, be it traffic or server CPU. Server performance
            is automatically improved when it reduces CPU usage or only serves static files. It also minimizes DOM
            manipulations that help improve performance.<br />

            Prototyping helps developers quickly initialize such features, get feedback, and make changes. A prototype
            not only helps to quickly create an application. This is also useful for small projects because it virtually
            stores pointers to each function.<br />

            Since the ultimate goal of an application is to provide the best experience for the end user, Angular JS
            allows developers to build applications with high-speed response for fast loading, smooth navigation, and
            more. What's more, a responsive web becomes efficient in terms of user experience, service, and more.<br />

            Developers do not need to work so hard to make web pages responsive as it automatically detects
            responsiveness based on the system being used.<br />

            As a conclusion, it can be noted that the study of statistical data on the considered frameworks allows you
            to make a choice in favor of React.js. It is it that can be recommended to learn by 2022. But in any case,
            each environment has its own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, which shifts the responsibility
            for the choice onto the shoulders of a particular developer.<br />
